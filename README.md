#### Add Functionality

The app has the following functionalities

- The _Score_ and _Total Score_ for the current game is **0** initially.
- When an **Emoji** is clicked

  - If the clicked emoji is not the same as any of the previously clicked emojis
    then the _Score_ will be increased by **1**.
  - If all the emojis are clicked exactly once

    - The _Game status_ along with _Best score_ and _Play Again_ button will
      be displayed as shown in the **design file (won game)**.
    - The _Best score_ will be equal to the _Top Score_

  - If the clicked emoji is the same as any of the previously clicked emojis

    - The _Game status_ along with _Current score_ and _Play Again_ button
      will be displayed as shown in the **design file (lose game)**.

    - If the score achieved in the current game is higher than the previous
      scores then the _Top Score_ will be updated accordingly.

- When the _Play Again_ button is clicked, then we will be able to play the
  game again.

- The _Play Again_ button will reset the game and _Score_ value but not the
  _Top Score_ value.


> ### _Things to Keep in Mind_
>
> - All components you implement should go in the `src/components` directory.
> - Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being
>   imported into the tests.
> - **Do not remove the pre-filled code**
> - Want to quickly review some of the concepts youâ€™ve been learning? Take a
>   look at the Cheat Sheets.
